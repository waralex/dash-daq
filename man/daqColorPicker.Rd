the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is truthy and

changed while using the app will keep that change, as long as
the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`.}

\item{persisted_props}{List of a value equal to: 'value's. Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing the
component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop can
normally be ignored.}

memory: only kept in memory, reset on page refresh.
local: window.localStorage, data is kept after the browser quit.
